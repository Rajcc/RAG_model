This is A Chatbot specifically for Bioinformatics domain which tells how to do homology,transcriptomics,tools availabel etc. this is Based on RETREIVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION which provides llms latest
data regarding any specific feild. As most llms are trained on static data they can hallucinate when asked question regarding any specific domain.i have used hugging face model for embedding
 data ,for storage of embedded data i have gone with chromadb which is a vector database and for chatbot i have used again huggingface inference model.my main focus here was integragtion of rag with
 llm so ui layer might not be impressive.
